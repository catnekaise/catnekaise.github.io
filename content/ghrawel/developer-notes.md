`gh`r`aw`el, because naming is hard.

My motivation for creating this was partially because of the cancelled feature [service-tokens](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/350) (temporary GitHub access tokens should be much easier than what it is today) and to explore if a cdk library can be viable when an application is required.

Hopefully documentation in [catnekaise/ghrawel](https://github.com/catnekaise/ghrawel) should answer most questions. If any issues please post an issue in that repository.
